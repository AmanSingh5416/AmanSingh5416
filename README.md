## About Me
I am Aman Singh, a B.Tech student in Mathematics & Computing at PEC Chandigarh. I focus on turning theoretical rigour into working systems: algorithms, full-stack web development, and polished user interfaces. I learn publicly, ship projects, and iterate fast. I prefer solutions that are efficient, well-tested, and production-minded.

---

## Goals
**Short-term (next 6–12 months)**  
- Build and ship 3+ end-to-end projects that showcase advanced software features (APIs + web UI).  
- Strengthen competitive programming and system-design fundamentals.  
- Secure an internship or part-time role in software engineering or backend systems.

**Medium-term (1–3 years)**  
- Transition into a role at a reputable MNC focused on backend systems or systems engineering.  
- Contribute meaningfully to open-source projects used in production.  
- Launch a technical portfolio (video + code) that demonstrates product-quality prototypes.

**Long-term (3+ years)**  
- Specialize in systems engineering or secure-by-design full-stack engineering.  
- Lead technical projects that bridge research and product (MVP → scaled service).  
- Mentor juniors and contribute to community learning resources.

## Selected Project

1. **Spotify Clone (Full-stack)** — A full-stack music streaming prototype that demonstrates large-scale UI, streaming playback, playlist management, and polished user experience.
   - **Key Features**
     - User authentication and profiles (email/password, session tokens)
     - Search for songs, artists, and albums; filter and sort results
     - Create, edit, and share playlists
     - Playback controls: play/pause, seek, next/previous, volume, repeat, shuffle
     - Persistent playback queue and local caching for smooth playback
     - Like/save tracks and playlist management
     - Responsive UI with polished animations and keyboard shortcuts
   - **Tech Stack**
     - Front-end: React, React Router, React Context / Redux (state management)
     - Back-end: Node.js + Express (REST API)
     - Data store: MongoDB (user data, playlists), optional PostgreSQL for relational features
     - Media: HTML5 Audio / Web Audio API for playback; AWS S3 or static hosting for demo media
     - DevOps: Docker for local development; scripts for building and running services
   - **Design & Engineering Considerations**
     - Cross-page persistent player and low-latency controls for a production-like feel
     - Efficient search and paginated APIs to handle large catalogs
     - Use of pre-signed URLs or tokenized access for secure media delivery in production
     - Demo content limited to sample or creative-commons tracks to respect licensing
   - **Status**
     - MVP complete: core playback, playlists, search, and user profiles implemented.
     - Next steps: social features, cross-device sync, stronger caching/streaming optimizations.

## Experience
Below is a summary of hands-on experience and responsibilities I have undertaken as a student and project developer.

- **Academic Projects & Coursework**
  - Implemented algorithms and system-level assignments covering complexity analysis, data structures, networking fundamentals, and database-backed applications.  
  - Built course projects demonstrating end-to-end development: design, implementation, testing, and documentation.

- **Hackathons & Rapid Prototyping**
  - Participated in multiple hackathons; experience shipping MVPs under tight deadlines, building product-focused demos, and pitching to judges.  
  - Skilled at prioritizing features that make products demonstrably useful during short development cycles.

- **Systems & Software Prototyping**
  - Hands-on with building prototypes, integrating external APIs, setting up reliable processing pipelines, and embedding those into web services.  
  - Worked on media playback and streaming patterns while building the Spotify clone: persistent players, stream buffering, and efficient media delivery.

## What I Bring
- Strong mathematical and algorithmic foundation.  
- Practical engineering: shipping prototypes that are testable and maintainable.  
- A product-first mindset: prioritize features that deliver clear user value.  
- High standards for documentation and code quality.

- GitHub: https://github.com/AmanSingh5416  
- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/aman-singh-a862b7347

If you’d like, I can:
- Add the Spotify clone repository link and a short README for that repo.  
- Generate demo GIFs/screenshots for the Spotify clone.  
- Produce a compact resume-style section tailored for recruiters.

## Closing Statement
I build with intent: thoughtful design, measurable outcomes, and a focus on scaling prototypes into reliable products. I’m actively looking to collaborate, intern, or contribute to interesting projects—reach out if our goals align.
